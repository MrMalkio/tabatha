## [v6.7.16] - Showcase expansion: full component inventory + card captures - _2026-07-16_

### Added

- **Showcase expanded to the whole user-facing surface area** — `showcase/index.html` is now an indexed gallery (sticky in-page nav, grouped sections, client-side filter) fronting **8 surface frames** and **6 new category pages** carrying **90 component cards**: `components-overlays.html` (InBar in 5 states, sticky note, edit dropdown, backburner, Gatekeeper strict/relaxed/inherited/agent, BlockGate, Welcome Back, What's New), `components-focus.html` (FocusBar active/paused/drifted/over-time/edit/checkpoint, FocusInput, queue, backburner dock, CheckpointTimeline, FlipClock, shift controls), `components-data.html` (every hand-rolled chart incl. the 365-day ActivityHeatmap and LogsPanel), `components-org.html` (TeamActivity, StatusChip's 9 states, invites, org tree, Live Stints, abandoned stints, Schedule's 3 modes), `components-settings.html` (all 22 shipped sections, sync chip's 5 states, SettingsSearch, all 12 themes, URL Rules, Developer, Cortex), and `components-primitives.html` (GlassCard, PopButton, ComboInput, TagPicker, CommandPalette, KeyboardShortcuts, LinkMergeModal, UnifiedTimeline). State variants are shown side by side wherever state is the point.
- **New surface frames** — `popup.html` (the 400×500 Quick Switch popup), `workshifts.html` (Work Shifts → Analytics), and `settings-sections.html` (all 22 sections + the live-preview column).
- **`npm run capture:showcase`** (plus `capture:shots` / `capture:cards`) — `scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs` now captures all 8 shot frames **and** every `.libcard` to `store-assets/screenshots/components/<page>--<card>.png` via CDP, validating each for dimensions and non-blankness. 98 assets in ~28s. The five Chrome Web Store shots keep their exact names and 1280×800 dimensions, now enforced by an explicit `cws` flag.

### Fixed

- **Showcase: invisible bars in the Work Shifts weekly and per-focus charts** — the fills are `<span>`s, so `height:100%` was silently ignored on an inline box and the bars rendered as empty tracks. They are `display:block` now.
- **Capture: a fixed CDP debug port made captures attach to the wrong browser** — an orphaned headless Chrome holding port 9333 meant every navigate/screenshot targeted a stale page (capture ran ~500× slower and produced blank cards). Chrome now picks a free port and reports it via `DevToolsActivePort`.

## [v6.7.15] - Component showcase / display pages - _2026-07-15_

### Added

- **`showcase/` component showcase** — polished, on-brand, self-contained HTML display pages for every key surface (Gatekeeper, sidebar, New Tab dashboard, Sync & Account settings, backdating / checkpoint timeline) plus a component library (InBar, BlockGate, TagPicker, tab rows, analytics, abandoned-stint modal). A reusable marketing / docs / onboarding asset rendered from the real design system (halved radius scale, Pop-Art palette, emoji iconography). Five pages double as the Chrome Web Store screenshots; `scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs` renders them to `store-assets/screenshots/*.png` at an exact 1280×800.

## [v6.7.14] - First complete self-hosted channel build - _2026-07-15_

### Changed

- First update-channel release built from the fully-merged line — combines the self-hosted updater (v6.7.13) with the backdating-actually-moves fix (v6.7.12), which the initial v6.7.13 release predated. This is the build the auto-updater serves to staff installs.

## [v6.7.13] - Self-hosted remote update channel for unpacked staff installs - _2026-07-15_

### Added

- **`scripts/publish-update.mjs` + `npm run publish:update`** — builds the WITH-key unpacked-staff package, zips `dist/` to `store-assets/tabatha-<version>.zip`, computes its sha256, publishes a GitHub Release (tag `ext-v<version>`, distinct from the project's `v<version>` tag scheme) with the zip attached, and commits `latest.json` (`{ version, zipUrl, sha256, published }`) to a dedicated `update-channel` branch — served at the stable URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrMalkio/tabatha/update-channel/latest.json`.
- **`scripts/tabatha-updater.ps1`** — polls that `latest.json`, compares semver against the installed stable-path manifest, and on a newer remote version: downloads the release zip, verifies its sha256 (aborts and leaves the current install untouched on any mismatch), validates the extracted build (manifest parses, pinned key present, entry pages present), then atomic-swaps it into `%LocalAppData%\Tabatha\extension` using the same never-empty rename pattern as `mirror-extension.ps1`. Logs to `%LocalAppData%\Tabatha\update.log`. Idempotent — no-op when already current.
- **`scripts/install-tabatha-staff.ps1`** — staff/multi-machine installer superseding `install-extension-persistence.ps1` for non-dev machines: seeds the stable path from a bundled `.\extension` payload, registers both an HKCU Run key (logon) and a Scheduled Task (every 6h) running the updater, and prints the one-time "Load unpacked" instruction.
- **`store-assets/tabatha-staff-v<version>.zip`** — refreshed staff bundle: built extension (WITH pinned key) + `tabatha-updater.ps1` + `install-tabatha-staff.ps1` + updated `INSTALL.md` documenting the 6h/logon auto-update cadence.
- This channel does NOT depend on Chrome Web Store review — it is live and testable on any staff machine (e.g. PS) the moment `npm run publish:update` is run once.

## [v6.7.12] - Backdating actually moves the start; overlap is reported, not blocked - _2026-07-15_

> Supersedes v6.7.10's clamp-feedback behavior: the anti-double-count clamp against other focuses is **removed**, not just explained.

### Fixed

- **Backdating a start time now actually moves the start — even when other focuses occupied that window.** The anti-double-count guard in `SET_FOCUS_START_TIME` treated every other focus (including the entire paused/queued backlog) as time already claimed and "resolved" overlap by shoving the proposed start *forward* to the latest interval end — with a full queue, that collapsed nearly every backdate into a silent no-op. The start the user picks now always takes effect, bounded only by two hard limits: not before clock-in, not in the future. Parallel/overlapping focuses are an accepted concept — overlap with another focus is now **reported, not silently blocked**: the editor confirms e.g. `Backdated to HH:MM — overlaps "Email triage" by 20m (both keep their time)`, and the timeline checkpoint notes the overlapped minutes.
- **Edits limited by the hard bounds explain themselves.** A backdate fully swallowed by the clock-in floor or the now ceiling keeps the editor open with why and the earliest available time; a partially bounded one confirms the effective time and credited minutes; a clean backdate briefly confirms `+Xm credited`. (Per-focus accounting is unchanged: credited `elapsedMs` is still capped at wall-clock since the new start.)

### Changed

- **`validateStartTime` contract:** bounds the start to `[clock-in, now]` only; `clamped`/`clampedBy` now reflect only those bounds (`'clock-in'` / `'now'`), and overlapping other-focus intervals are returned as `overlaps` (with per-interval `overlapMs` and the sibling's `label`) for the caller to surface. `SET_FOCUS_START_TIME` response adds `overlaps` alongside `startedAt`/`addedMs`/`clamped`/`clampedBy`. A follow-up will let the user trim the overlap from the other focus or move it to backburner time.

---

## [v6.7.11] - Chrome Web Store packaging: real icons, promo tile, store zip, privacy policy - _2026-07-15_

### Added

- **True multi-resolution icons.** `public/icons/icon16/32/48/128.png` are now real 16/32/48/128px exports (previously all three shipped the same mislabeled 1024×1024 PNG). The 1024px original is preserved as `public/icons/icon-1024.png`; the manifest (`icons` + `action.default_icon`) now also declares the 32px size.
- **`scripts/build-store-zip.mjs` + `npm run build:store`** — builds, stages `dist`, strips the pinned `key` from the staged manifest (Chrome Web Store rejects uploads carrying one), validates the payload (entry pages, icons, no sourcemaps/dotfiles), and zips to `store-assets/tabatha-store-v<version>.zip`.
- **Store promo tile** — `store-assets/promo-440x300.png` (icon + wordmark + tagline on brand dark).
- **`PRIVACY.md`** — plain-language privacy policy (from the listing doc's disclosure section), hosted publicly for the store's privacy-policy URL requirement.
- **Staff interim bundle** — `store-assets/tabatha-staff-unpacked-v<version>.zip` (built extension WITH pinned key + persistence installer + 3-step INSTALL.md) so existing unpacked installs keep their extension ID until the store listing is live.

---

## [v6.7.9] - Stable extension load path (stops "uninstalling on restart") - _2026-07-15_

### Fixed

- **The extension no longer disappears after a restart.** Chrome loaded the unpacked extension straight from the git build folder (`…\Tabatha\dist`), which `npm run build` legitimately empties/rewrites. Any restart — made frequent and unattended by Windows Fast Startup, and Chrome's startup extension-GC after an unclean exit — that landed while `dist` was mid-build/invalid caused Chrome to permanently drop the unpacked entry, forcing a manual "Load unpacked". The load path is now decoupled from the git tree: a stable mirror at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tabatha\extension` is kept populated with the freshest **valid** build and self-heals on logon, so Chrome always validates against a complete folder.

### Added

- **`scripts/mirror-extension.ps1`** — atomically mirrors a valid `dist` build into the stable load path (validates manifest + pinned key + entry pages before swapping; leaves the last-known-good copy untouched if the source is missing/mid-build).
- **`scripts/install-extension-persistence.ps1`** — one-time machine setup: seeds the stable path and registers a logon autostart (scheduled task, or HKCU Run-key fallback) that re-mirrors/self-heals before Chrome starts. Prints the one-time "Load unpacked from the stable path" step.
- **`npm run mirror:extension`** — refresh the stable load path on demand after a build.

---

## [v6.7.8] - Sync review fixes: durable fallback + per-op outbox persistence - _2026-07-10_

### Fixed

- **Display-name saves can no longer silently vanish.** If the service worker was asleep or torn down mid-message (a routine MV3 race), `saveDisplayName` used to swallow the failed `sendMessage` into a fabricated `{ ok: true }` — nothing was queued, no retry armed, and the cloud row stayed stale with a "✓ syncing" message. `updateProfileName` now falls back to persisting the write directly into the durable outbox (`_cloudOutbox`) and arms the flush alarm; only a genuine local-persist failure surfaces a real, retryable error to the user.
- **Cloud outbox honours its at-most-once-per-success contract under teardown.** `flushCloudOutbox` now persists the queue after each op's success/failure inside the loop instead of once at the end, so a service-worker teardown mid-flush can't re-execute an op whose network write already landed.

---

## [v6.7.7] - Background-routed cloud writes + outbox queue (page auth hang fixed) - _2026-07-10_

### Fixed

- **Root-caused and killed the page-context Cloud Sync hang.** Saving a display name, creating an organisation, or redeeming/minting an invite from Settings (and Work Shifts schedule reads) could hang ~10–15s then time out, and the Account panel logged `auth_init_failed`. The cause was a self-deadlock inside the page's auth client: its init lock is held while `onAuthStateChange` subscribers run, and the subscriber's nested cloud read re-entered that same lock forever. The `onAuthStateChange` callback now defers all follow-up work off its microtask (never `await`s a cloud call inline), so the client can never wedge.

### Added

- **Background is now the single Cloud auth owner.** Page contexts source the session and access token from the background service worker (`GET_AUTH_STATE` / `GET_ACCESS_TOKEN`) and read via a deadlock-proof data client configured with an `accessToken` callback — it never runs page-local auth machinery. Realtime (team activity, live profile) keeps working on the routed token.
- **Cloud outbox — queue, never race.** Display-name changes enqueue to a durable, idempotency-keyed queue (`src/utils/cloudOutbox.js`) with latest-wins dedupe and exponential backoff, flushed by the background. The UI gets an instant optimistic ack instead of a 10s timeout race; the name updates locally, survives a reload, and reconciles on cloud confirm. Survives service-worker restarts.
- **All cloud mutations routed through the background** (`UPDATE_PROFILE_NAME`, `CREATE_ORGANIZATION`, `REDEEM_INVITE_TOKEN`, `CREATE_INVITE_TOKEN`, `DELETE_INVITE_TOKEN`) so they execute against the never-wedged background client.
- **Auto-sync on sign-in.** Signing in now triggers a full sync + outbox flush automatically (also on service-worker boot) — no need to click "Cloud Sync now" (kept as a manual fallback).

---

## [v6.7.6] - UI: hide backend vendor name in Cloud Sync label - _2026-07-10_

### Changed

- **UI:** renamed the "Supabase Cloud Sync" integration label to "Cloud Sync" (hide backend vendor name from end users).

---

## [v6.7.5] - Session-log housekeeping - _2026-07-10_

### Changed

- Docs/session-log housekeeping; version discipline reconciliation.

---

## [v6.7.3] - Cortex capture-config reconnect-flap guard - _2026-07-10_

### Fixed

- **A settings read racing an MV3 SW-restart storm could silently flap desktop capture off** for as long as ~90 seconds. `pushCaptureConfig()` ran unconditionally on every companion-bridge reconnect; since `getSettings()` always merges onto `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` (`screenshotCapture: false`), a read before the raw `settings` key was confirmed loaded resolved to "off" and pushed that guess to the companion. Added `isSettingsLoaded()` — a pure guard that distinguishes "genuinely not configured yet" from "confirmed loaded" — so the push is skipped rather than asserting a false negative.

---

## [v6.7.2] - Cortex panel: surface the real capture folder - _2026-07-10_

### Added

- **"Where are my captures?"** — the Cortex panel now shows the desktop companion's actual on-disk frames directory and a live "last frame written" timestamp, instead of only the extension's own observation-ledger count. The companion's `GET_CAPTURE_STATE` reply is now persisted (`companionCaptureState`) and re-requested on every bridge reconnect via a new `GET_COMPANION_CAPTURE_STATE` handler.

---

## [v6.7.1] - Awareness identity-race fix (Live Stints ghost cards) - _2026-07-10_

### Fixed

- **Live Stints ghost cards / silent no-ops on cold start.** `LIST_LIVE_STINTS`, `GET_OTHER_QUEUE`, `CLOCK_OUT_INSTALL`, `DISMISS_INSTALL`, `CLEAR_ALL_OFFLINE`, and the auto-clock-in abandoned-stint check all hard-guarded on the module-level identity `startAwareness()` sets — before that resolves (fresh service-worker spin-up, or a restart mid-startup), they silently returned empty. Added `resolveActiveIdentity()`, a fallback that re-derives the profile/install identity directly from the Supabase session when module state isn't populated yet, and wired it into all five call sites plus `getOwnAbandonedStints()`.

---

## [v6.7.0] - Work Schedule Profiles (NB-01/NB-02) - _2026-07-10_

### Added

- **Work Schedule Profiles**: per-member `dedicated_hours` / `self_managed` work profiles, required-hours floors at daily/weekly/monthly cadences (independent, anti-back-loading), a fixed weekly schedule editor, and a schedule-change-request flow (slot change / shift hours / make-up) with a manager approval inbox.
- **Shortfall tracking**: a `shortfall_ledger` records under-hours periods at clock-out (fire-and-forget, fail-open when signed out/offline) with resolutions (`unresolved` / `made_up` / `shifted` / `excused`) and a `SHORTFALL_PROMPT` notification.
- **Work Shifts → Schedule view**: three modes — **Self** (own schedule, floors, shortfall accounting, change requests), **Manage** (roster, profile type, slots, floors — gated by org role/permissions), and **Requests** (approval inbox). The legacy local `workSchedule` key is kept as an offline cache and signed-out editor.
- **Migration 027** (renumbered from the branch's original 023; applied): `org_members.work_profile_type`, `work_requirements`, `work_schedule_slots`, `schedule_change_requests`, `shortfall_ledger`, plus 4 hardened `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs (`set_member_schedule`, `set_work_requirements`, `set_member_work_profile`, `decide_change_request`) — `search_path=''`, schema-qualified, `REVOKE PUBLIC/anon`, `GRANT authenticated`.

---

## [v6.6.0] - Org management foundation, real analytics, time-editing overhaul + critical storage fix - _2026-07-06_

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL — pause/resume (and all state changes) silently failing**: the extension's `chrome.storage.local` hit Chrome's 10 MB quota, so every state-changing write was rejected while reads kept working — the UI looked alive but nothing persisted. Added the `unlimitedStorage` permission, and storage write failures now surface loudly (console + notification) instead of being swallowed. (Requires the one-time extension reload that delivers this version.)
- **Sync survives schema drift**: if the client is ever ahead of the database (a missing column), sync now retries that block without the column and reports a named diagnostic instead of failing outright.

### Added

- **Work Shifts → Analytics is real** (for everyone, including personal installs): daily hours, weekly comparison, peak productivity hours, break patterns, time-per-focus during shifts, context-switching frequency, and CSV export — all computed from your own data. Org/cross-member analytics ships next (org admins only).
- **Org roles foundation**: owner/admin are org-wide; managers are scoped to their own teams. New permission helpers gate every org-management surface. (The full Work Schedule + work-profiles system is built and lands in the next update, once its database migrations are applied.)
- **Time editing that actually works**: type durations like "500m" or "8h20m" (set total / add / subtract), live preview incl. clamp warnings, Enter-to-apply, edit panel available even with no checkpoints, and honest feedback when a limit clamps your edit.
- **Offline-gap detection**: if the machine was off/asleep while an intent was running, Tabatha now detects the gap on wake, retro-pauses at the gap start, and asks you to confirm/credit/adjust — no more phantom hours.
- **Abandoned-stint prompt at clock-in**: your own orphaned stints surface when you clock in, with an end-time picker to correct them on the spot.
- **Settings search**: press "/" in Settings and fuzzy-find any option; sync/companion status chips now click through to Sync & Account.

---

## [v6.5.0] - Dogfood fix batch: clock sync, onboarding, crash-hardening + new features - _2026-07-01_

### Added

- **Create Organization** (Settings → Sync & Account): self-serve org creation via a new `tabatha.create_organization` SECURITY DEFINER RPC (migration 020) that atomically creates the org, an owner membership, and stamps the profile default — closing the chicken-and-egg gap where the very first user of an org had no way to bootstrap one. (FIX-09)
- **Cross-device intent queue**: device chips in the awareness strip now expand to show each other signed-in machine/profile's **read-only** intent queue, with P-priority synced (migration 021 adds `focus_items.priority`). (FIX-10)
- **"What's New" update popup + changelog**: a one-time-per-version modal summarizing changes on upgrade (generated from this changelog into `public/changelog.json`), plus a full Changelog view in Settings → About. (FIX-11)
- **Configurable toolbar-icon click**: choose whether clicking the toolbar icon opens the side panel (new default) or the tab-list popup, plus a rebindable `open_tab_list` keyboard shortcut. (FIX-12)
- **Companion (Tabby Desk):** file-based crash logging + global panic hook, and user-visible "Check for Updates" feedback via the tray. (FIX-04/06)

### Fixed

- **Companion → extension clock sync**: the companion's clock state was written to the wrong storage key and never reached the `clockSession` that Home reads (plus a snake/camel shape mismatch), so tray/Desk-panel clock in/out never showed on Home. Now mapped and persisted correctly. (FIX-02/05)
- **Invite-join was silently broken**: the `redeem_invite_token` RPC call wasn't schema-qualified (`.schema('tabatha')`) → PGRST202. Redeeming an invite token now works. (FIX-09)
- **Companion crashes / "vanishing"**: a poisoned-`Mutex` cascade (`.lock().unwrap()` everywhere) took the whole process down after any single panic. Replaced with poison-recovering locks, a `catch_unwind`-wrapped monitor loop, and panic-hook file logging. (FIX-06)
- **Activity Log** opened a broken terminal (`cmd /c "type … & pause"`) and could take the companion down; now opens the report via the OS default handler from the app-data `logs/` folder. (FIX-03)
- **Intent queue** no longer disappears when there is no active intent — it always renders, with a muted empty state. (FIX-08)
- **External Integrations panel** now reflects the live Desktop Companion connection (`companionConnected`) instead of a never-written flag that always read "Not configured". (FIX-01)

### Changed

- **Toolbar default**: clicking the extension icon now opens the **side panel** by default (previously the popup); the popup is reachable via the setting or the new hotkey. (FIX-12)
- **Companion UI copy**: "Debug Panel" → "Desk Panel", "Tabatha Desktop" → "Tabby Desk", "Tracking" → "Tabbing"; the version is now read from the build instead of hard-coded. (FIX-07)
- **Companion release profile**: `panic = "abort"` → `"unwind"` so crash-containment (`catch_unwind` / poison recovery) is actually effective. (FIX-06)
- **Migrations**: 020 (`create_organization` RPC + `org_members.role` CHECK reconciled to include `owner`, hardened `search_path = ''`), 021 (`focus_items.priority` column). Authored + Koda-reviewed; applied at deploy.

---

## [v6.4.0] - Ghost-stint fix: durable install identity + Live Stints panel - _2026-06-04_

### Added

- **Live Stints panel** (Work Shifts → Live Stints view): lists all browser-profile installs currently clocked in — self, live siblings, and dead orphans — with per-install badges (live/stale/machine group), clock-in timestamp, last-seen heartbeat, and individual **Clock out** / **Dismiss** actions. Dead orphans show an end-time picker prefilled with `last_heartbeat_at`. Bulk **Clean up all offline** removes all stale presence rows in one step.
- **`OtherProfilesStrip` stale-collapse**: the awareness strip now shows only live chips; stale orphans collapse into a single `🕘 N offline · clean up` chip that links to the Live Stints panel.
- **Home clock indicator**: a compact chip near the home clock links to the Live Stints panel when sibling stints are present.
- **New background handlers** in `awarenessService`: `LIST_LIVE_STINTS`, `CLOCK_OUT_INSTALL`, `DISMISS_INSTALL`, `CLEAR_ALL_OFFLINE`.
- **Self-command listener** on the Supabase Realtime subscription: a live sibling install can be clocked out remotely by writing `metadata.clock_out_requested_at`; the target install runs its own local clock-out sequence.
- **Pure reconciliation helpers** (`src/utils/stintReconciliation.js`): `isLiveConcurrent`, `reconstructStintFromStatus`, `resolveAttributionTarget`, `classifyInstallForCleanup`. 26 unit tests.

### Fixed

- **Concurrent-shift false warning**: the "hours may stack and double-count" popup now only fires for a genuinely live, same-classification install. Dead orphans (stale/offline) and installs with a different classification (personal vs professional) no longer trigger the warning.

### Changed

- **Durable install identity** (migration 017): `browser_profiles` gains `local_id` (stable per-install UUID) and `machine_id` (companion browser-profile link). A unique index on `(profile_id, local_id)` makes `ensureBrowserProfileRow` idempotent — the same install always maps to one row, regardless of concurrent syncs or storage resets. Existing rows keep `local_id IS NULL` and are reconciled via the Live Stints panel.

---

## [v6.3.2] - QA regression fixes (idle overlay, sidebar parity, domain backfill) - _2026-05-29_

### Fixed

- **D1 — Idle overlay was dismissed when user moved their mouse.** Chrome fires `idle→active` when mouse moves, which was broadcasting `IDLE_PROMPT_RESOLVED` and removing the overlay. Now only dismissed on `timeout` (the hard-pause fallback). The user can move their mouse and click a response button.
- **G — Domain Groups tab was empty on first load.** `recordDomainVisit` only fires on new navigations; existing tracked tabs were never recorded. Background now scans `chrome.storage.local.tabs` on startup and backfills the domain history.
- **B7 — Meeting-domain textarea couldn't start a new line.** `onChange` was calling `filter(Boolean)`, deleting empty lines immediately when Enter was pressed. Now uses local draft state, saved to settings on blur.
- **Notification icons** — `icons/icon128.png` relative path fails in service worker; replaced with `chrome.runtime.getURL(...)`.
- **Timeline note text** — multi-line notes now render with `white-space: pre-wrap` instead of collapsing to one paragraph.

### Added

- **Sidebar parity** — Sidebar active-focus card now has 📊 checkpoint timeline (full edit mode), 📱/📴 off-device toggle, and 📌 Sub-focus button.
- **`CheckpointTimeline` shared component** (`src/components/CheckpointTimeline.jsx`) used by both home FocusBar and sidebar.
- **Auto-focus chip** fade extended 8s → 20s (chip was disappearing before user could dismiss InPop).

---

## [v6.3.1] - Self-review fix: stale meeting tab no longer disables idle - _2026-05-29_

### Fixed

- **Forgotten meeting tab permanently disabled idle detection.** `isUserInMeeting()` treated any meeting-domain tab open >2min as an active call, so a Zoom/Meet tab left open all day suppressed idle pausing indefinitely. The "muted backgrounded meeting" signal is now bounded to the meeting grace window (`meetingIdleGraceMinutes`, default 60m) and an explicit active-tab signal was added. Recently-joined muted meetings are still detected; stale tabs are not. (Found in a pre-PR self-review; guarded by new regression tests.)

---

## [v6.3.0] - Plan 037 Phase 2 Checkpoint Timeline Editing - _2026-05-29_

### Added

- **Timeline edit mode**: the checkpoint timeline (📊) now has an **✏️ Edit / ✓ Done** toggle. In edit mode you can:
  - Edit any note's text and progress level inline (✏️ per entry).
  - Delete any entry (✕), including auto-generated system entries.
  - Add a new checkpoint note (+ Add checkpoint note).
  - Adjust tracked time with clearer UI — the total is shown prominently with an explanation, so the time controls are no longer cryptic.
- New handlers `EDIT_CHECKPOINT` and `DELETE_CHECKPOINT` (focusService).

### Changed

- The "Adjust tracked time" controls now live inside Edit mode with a labelled total and helper text (previously an unexplained button row).

---

## [v6.2.0] - Plan 038 Phase 1 Persistent Domain Store - _2026-05-29_

### Added

- **Persistent domain history** (`domainHistoryService`): Tabatha now permanently remembers every domain (and its path variations, visit count, and observed intents) you visit — independent of whether the tab is still open. Capped at 2000 domains (configurable), LRU-evicted. This is the data backbone for building URL rules at any time, not just for currently-open sites.
- **Settings → URL Rules → Domain Groups** rebuilt on the persistent store: search/filter, visit count, last-seen, live-open indicator, and per-domain **⭐ Target** (prompt me to make a rule next visit), **🚫 Dismiss** (hide + stop prompting), and **↩ Restore** actions. A "Show dismissed" toggle reveals hidden domains.

---

## [v6.1.0] - Plan 037 Focus Time Editing + Plan 036 QA fixes - _2026-05-29_

### Added

- **Focus time editing** (Plan 037): the checkpoint timeline (📊) gains a "🛠 Adjust tracked time" row — quick deltas (−5m/−1m/+1m/+5m), a set-exact-minutes input, and **Remove last pause** (restores the time a pause ate and reactivates the focus). New handlers `ADJUST_FOCUS_TIME`, `SET_FOCUS_ELAPSED`, `REMOVE_LAST_PAUSE`, all clamped to wall-clock time and audit-logged.
- **Auto-pause master toggle** (`autoPauseEnabled`): Settings → Focus Lifecycle. When off, going idle never mutates any focus — not even a prompt.

### Fixed

- **Off-device focuses are no longer paused by idle.** Both `handleIdleStateChanged` and `hardPauseActiveFocus` now exempt `offDevice` focuses, fixing the time-data corruption where an off-device focus was silently paused while the user worked outside Chrome.
- **Tooltips no longer clip off-screen.** Tooltip x-position is clamped to the viewport and long text wraps (max 280px) — fixes the cut-off tooltips in Settings and everywhere else.
- **Meeting-domain editor**: the textarea now splits on newlines only (not commas), shows a format placeholder + Enter hint, and stops host-page keyboard shortcuts from intercepting input.

---

## [v6.0.0] - Plan 036 Intelligent Focus Lifecycle — Smart Idle + Auto-Focus + Drift - _2026-05-29_

Absorbs Plans 026 (Auto Focus) and 029 (Auto-Pause Overhaul). Resolves bugs B05/B08 and addresses features #149–#152, #187. Incorporates the challenge-audit resolutions (multi-profile sync race, meeting detection, drift false-positives, prompt-storm mitigation).

### Added

- **Smart Idle Engine** (`clockService`): before pausing the global focus, `collectIdleSuppressors()` consults (a) other browser profiles via the awareness cache, (b) desktop-companion activity within a configurable grace window, and (c) a hardened 3-layer `isUserInMeeting()` scan (all open tabs + companion app), so muted/backgrounded meetings and cross-profile activity no longer trigger false pauses. When idle is genuine, an `IDLE_PROMPT` is shown ("Yes, on task" / "I diverged" / "Pause focus") instead of a silent hard-pause; an unanswered prompt falls back to a hard pause after 5 minutes. Legacy hard-pause is still available via the "Prompt before pausing" toggle.
- **Multi-profile idle state** (`awarenessService`): each profile now publishes its Chrome idle verdict in the `browser_profile_status.metadata` jsonb (no schema migration) and surfaces it in the `_otherProfiles` cache, fixing the multi-profile sync-override hazard where an unattended profile could pause an actively-worked focus account-wide.
- **Auto-Focus heuristic engine** (`autoFocusService`): when no focus is active, tab activations/navigations are matched against URL rules (explicit auto-create), category/domain groups (high confidence), and the companion app category (medium), surfacing a non-blocking InBar chip that auto-fades after 8s. A per-domain exponential decay engine (30→60→120→240→480m) suppresses repeat prompts after dismissal.
- **Context drift detection** (`autoFocusService`): a 5-layer association hierarchy (direct association, companion overrule, URL-rule intent, category/domain-group, hostname) plus a localhost/chrome:// whitelist decides whether a tab counts as drift. A wandering→drifted state machine (armed by the `auto-focus-drift` alarm at `driftThresholdMinutes`) raises `FOCUS_DRIFT_DETECTED` with "Still working / Switching / Just checking" options and emits a `context_drift` webhook.
- **Auto clock-in (#187)**: optional, with a configurable trigger — "When Chrome opens" (default, via `runtime.onStartup`) or "On OS unlock" (via the desktop companion's idle→active transition).
- **Companion bridge helpers** (`companionService`): `lastHeartbeat`, `getActiveApp`/`getActiveAppCategory`, and `isRecentlyActive(grace)` for the idle and drift engines.
- **Settings → 🧠 Focus Lifecycle** panel: idle behaviour (prompt toggle, thresholds, companion grace, meeting-domain editor), auto-focus (enable, confidence, dismissal-history viewer/clear), drift detection (enable + thresholds), and auto clock-in (enable + trigger). URL Rules gain a per-rule **🎯 Auto-create focus** toggle.

### Changed

- Idle handling no longer mutates the global focus when the user is active on another profile, in another desktop app, or in a meeting — it only updates this profile's own status.

## [v5.8.0] - Plan 031 Gap Completion — Auto-Checkpoint + SectionNav + Sub-Focus + Backburner Fixes - _2026-05-28_

### Added

- **Auto-Checkpoint System** (`focusService.autoCheckpoint`): Lifecycle transitions (started, paused, resumed, completed, backburnered) now automatically generate system checkpoint entries. These appear in the Checkpoint Timeline with ⚙️ prefix at 60% opacity, distinguishable from manual user-submitted notes. System entries do not count toward the badge number or trigger stale-nudge timers.
- **Sub-Focus Button** (FocusBar): `📌 Sub-focus` button in the FocusBar action row. Creates a child focus under the currently active parent. Queue items with a parent now display a purple `child` badge.
- **SectionNav Sidebar Refactor**: Homepage navigation sidebar is now hover-expandable (44px icons → 160px icon+title on hover). Smart click logic: clicking an active section collapses it; clicking a different section navigates to it and auto-expands. Collapsed sections drop to the bottom of the sidebar with a divider and line-through styling. Collapsed section headers no longer render in the page body (zero-height anchor only), saving vertical real estate.
- **Feature Spec #209** (`docs/features/209-focus-resolution-tab-cleanup.md`): Documented the Focus Resolution & Tab Cleanup feature for future implementation.

### Fixed

- **Backburner create-new-focus skeleton** (Critical): When backburnering a focus and choosing "Create New", the replacement focus object was missing 12 fields (`funnelStage`, `timerMinutes`, `createdAt`, `pausedAt`, `endedAt`, `overMs`, `parentFocusId`, `contextSwitchCount`, `priority`, `offDevice`, `lastCheckpointAt`, `checkpointSnoozedUntil`). These undefined values broke the priority dropdown, funnel stage picker, and timer display. Now uses the canonical field set matching `startFocus`.
- **Backburner tab association inheritance**: Create-new-focus during backburner now inherits `associatedTabIds` from the backburnered focus and cross-links via `backburnerTransitionFocusId` for audit trail.
- **`addFocus` missing priority**: The `addFocus` function (used when adding to queue) was missing the `priority` field, causing the priority selector in FocusQueue to render undefined. Now defaults to P5.
- **Checkpoint badge count inflation**: The `📋 (N)` badge on the FocusBar was counting all checkpoint entries including system auto-entries, inflating the number. Badge now filters to user-only; timeline visibility uses total count.
- **Video call idle suppression**: Idle detection now checks both audible meeting tabs (existing) AND the active tab's URL against meeting domain patterns (Meet, Zoom, Teams, WebEx). Prevents premature auto-pausing during muted calls or meeting waiting rooms.
- **Regression RT-2**: LogsPanel type column added (replaces colored badge in details column).
- **Regression RT-7**: Category override logic for domain-specific patterns (Meet → Communication, Scholar → Research).

## [v5.3.0] - Plan 028 Phase D₂ — companion as a first-class install + clock-stacking warning + invite revocation - _2026-05-19_

### Added

- **Desktop companion proxy-registers as a `browser_profiles` row** (`browser='desktop_companion'`). On every WebSocket connect the extension SELECTs-or-INSERTs the companion's row and caches its id locally as `_companionBrowserProfileId`. Migration 013 adds a partial unique index `(profile_id, browser)` WHERE `browser IN ('desktop_companion', 'mobile_ios', 'mobile_android', 'tabatha_web')` so concurrent races resolve cleanly.
- **`companionInstallService`** heartbeats the companion's `browser_profile_status` row every 60 seconds while WS is connected; pushes immediately on `CLOCK_STATE` messages from the companion; flips `online=false` on disconnect. The awareness chip strip and Team Activity panel now render the companion alongside browser profiles (💻 icon).
- **Clock-stacking warning.** Home dashboard and sidebar `CLOCK_IN` paths consult the cached `_otherProfiles` awareness data; if any other non-personal install is currently `clocked_in` or `on_break`, a confirm dialog lists them before allowing a second concurrent shift to start. Personal installs are excluded from the check because they have no clock.
- **Pending Invites list** in Settings → Sync & Account → Team Activity. Org owners and managers see all unredeemed, unexpired tokens for their orgs with a per-row Revoke button (direct `DELETE` against `invite_tokens` — RLS gates server-side). The Generate Invite flow auto-refreshes the pending list on mint.

### Changed

- **Desktop activity attribution.** `syncService.buildDesktopRows` now stamps `desktop_activity` rows with the companion's `browser_profile_id` instead of the extension's whenever a companion install exists. Existing rows pre-D₂ remain attributed to the extension — that's acceptable; future companion activity is correctly scoped.
- **Awareness chip icons** prefer `BROWSER_ICON[row.browser]` over `CLASSIFICATION_ICON[row.classification]` so the companion (💻), future mobile (📱), and web (🌐) installs are visually distinct from Chrome profiles.

### Migration

Run `supabase/migrations/013_companion_install_uniqueness.sql`. The unique index is partial — Chrome browser_profiles stay free-form so users with multiple Chrome profiles on one machine continue to work.

### Out of scope (still parked for Phase D₃+)

- Multi-machine companion support (today: one companion per user). A stable per-machine identifier on `profile_path` is the next step.
- Mobile app(s) (iOS / Android) registering their own `browser_profiles` rows. The schema and unique index are already in place; the mobile clients need to do the upsert themselves.
- Auto-update distribution via Chrome Web Store / signed CRX (Plan 019).

---

## [v5.2.0] - Plan 028 first slice — Team Activity + Invite Mint + profile realtime - _2026-05-19_

### Added

- **Team Activity panel** (Settings → Sync & Account) for org owners and team managers. Lists each member you can see, with their browser-profile installs and live awareness chips. Refreshes via Supabase Realtime on every status change.
- **Generate Invite Token** mint UI. Org owners and team managers/sub-managers can mint tokens directly from Settings — pick org, optionally a team, role, and expiry hours; copy the resulting token. Pairs with the existing redemption flow.
- **Manager RLS scoping** (migration 012) for `tabatha.browser_profiles`, `tabatha.browser_profile_status`, and `tabatha.profiles`. Org owners can read all members in their orgs; team owners/managers/sub-managers can read their team members. Insert/update/delete remain own-row.
- **`tabatha.profiles` realtime subscription** in `useAuth` — `display_name`, `avatar_url`, `default_realm` etc. update live across browsers without a page reload.

### Fixed

- **`useChromeStorage.update` race condition.** The `valueRef`-based update path could be one render stale, letting rapid concurrent writes overwrite each other (the lingering "Profile Name doesn't save on one of my browsers" report). Replaced with functional `setValue(prev => …)` so `prev` is guaranteed to be the latest committed state. Universal fix — covers every callsite, not just the install identity.

### Migration

Run `supabase/migrations/011_add_profiles_to_realtime.sql` then `012_manager_scoping_and_invite_mint.sql` before relying on Team Activity or live profile updates.

### Out of scope (still parked for Phase D₂+)

- Desktop companion registers as a `browser_profiles` row (`browser='desktop_companion'`).
- Mobile app(s) follow the same identity pattern.
- Auto-update distribution via Chrome Web Store / signed CRX (Plan 019).

---

## [v5.1.1] - Phase A race fix + classification explainer + invite-token note - _2026-05-19_

### Fixed

- **Classification picker stuck on Professional / wouldn't save.** The eager-init useEffect's storage write was racing the user's first edit — `valueRef.current` could still be the stale DEFAULT, and the second write clobbered `localId` back to null. New self-healing `writeIdentity` ensures `localId` + `createdAt` exist on every write, so the race is impossible. Same fix covers profile-name edits.

### Added

- **Per-classification explainer** beneath the Classification picker, updates live with the selection. Covers what each of Business / Professional / Work / Personal *means* in terms of clock visibility, default realm, and cross-profile presentation.
- **Per-option tooltips** on each Classification dropdown option.
- **Invite Token clarification.** Added a small explainer above the Team Invite Token input noting that redemption works end-to-end but token *creation* doesn't have UI yet — admins generate tokens directly in the cloud console. The mint UI ships with the manager dashboard.

---

## [v5.1.0] - Multi-Profile Awareness Sync Phase C + Phase A polish - _2026-05-19_

### Added

- **Cross-profile awareness substrate** (`tabatha.browser_profile_status`). Each install upserts its own row with clock state + active focus state on every transition; refreshes a `last_heartbeat_at` on a 60-second tick. Other installs subscribe via Supabase Realtime and render compact chips on the home dashboard ("Personal 🏠 · 🎯 Slack · 6m").
- **`awarenessService.js`** — manages heartbeat, debounced state pushes, realtime subscription, and the `_otherProfiles` local cache.
- **`OtherProfilesStrip` component** + **`useOtherProfiles` hook** — render the awareness chips with stale/offline dimming when no heartbeat in 5 minutes.
- **Eager Install ID initialisation** in the `useInstallIdentity` React hook so the UI is responsive immediately, not blocked on the first sync.
- **Save feedback** in Settings → Browser Profile: "saving… / ✓ saved / save failed" pill next to the section header.
- **Immediate cloud push on Classification change** (no longer waiting for the next sync alarm).

### Changed

- **Verbiage:** "Supabase" replaced with "cloud" / "Account" / "database" in user-facing copy. The settings sidebar entry "☁️ Sync & Supabase" is now "☁️ Sync & Account"; the re-pull dialog says "re-pull from the cloud"; the workshifts export stub says "Sync to Cloud".

### Migration

Run `supabase/migrations/010_add_browser_profile_status.sql` before the cross-profile awareness chips will populate. Adds the status table, RLS policies, and adds the table to the `supabase_realtime` publication.

### Known limitations / out of scope

- The desktop companion does not yet register a `browser_profiles` row (`browser = 'desktop_companion'`); awareness chips for the companion will arrive in Phase D.
- Clock-stacking warnings (when multiple non-personal profiles clock in simultaneously) are visualised by the chips but not yet inline-blocked. Deliberate — we want to observe stacking patterns before deciding the UX.
- Manager-scoped views over org_members' profiles still rely on a future RLS expansion.

---

## [v5.0.0] - Multi-Profile Awareness Sync Phase A+B - _2026-05-19_

### Added

- **Per-install browser-profile identity** stored locally in `_browserProfile` (chrome.storage.local). Each Chrome profile on each machine gets a stable `localId` on first run and a `supabaseId` on first sync.
- **`tabatha.browser_profiles` is now active.** Every install upserts a row carrying its classification, profile name, and `last_seen_at`. The table has been present since migration 001; this release wires it up.
- **Classification axis** (per-install): Business / Professional / Work / Personal. Distinct from the user-level `profiles.default_realm`. Picker lives in Settings → Appearance → "This Browser Profile".
- **Bootstrap pull of org registry.** On first sync after sign-in, every `tabatha.{operations,initiatives,clients,projects,tasks_registry}` row for the user is fetched and merged into local `tabathaOrg` by name (case-insensitive). Prevents duplicate clients/projects/tasks when signing in on a second browser profile or machine.
- **`↻ Re-pull registry`** button in Settings → Sync — clears the bootstrap watermark and re-runs the merge on demand.
- **Stamp `browser_profile_id`** on every push: `focus_items`, `intent_history`, `clock_sessions`, `desktop_activity`, `operations`, `initiatives`, `clients`, `projects`, `tasks_registry`. The server can now attribute every row to the install that produced it.
- **`useInstallIdentity()` React hook** exposes `{ identity, isPersonal, isReady, setClassification, setProfileName }` to UI surfaces.

### Changed

- **Personal-classified profiles hide clock-in / clock-out / break controls** in the home dashboard's Shift Controls section, the sidebar header, and the Command Palette. Time-and-attention breakdowns (UnifiedTimeline, AnalyticsDashboard, workshifts) remain visible everywhere.
- **`applyDefaultRealm` (focusService)** now reads `_browserProfile.classification` first, falling back to the legacy `tabathaSettings.defaultRealm`. New focuses created on a Personal profile default to `realm=personal` independent of the user-level default.
- Settings → Appearance → Browser Profile rebuilt into a "This Browser Profile" card: Install ID (last-12 of supabaseId), editable Profile Name, Classification picker.

### Migration

Run `supabase/migrations/009_add_browser_profile_stamp.sql` before relying on the new stamping behaviour. Until 009 is applied, push diagnostics will report column-missing errors for `browser_profile_id`.

### Required next steps after install

1. Set the **Classification** for this browser profile in Settings → Appearance.
2. Hit **↻ Sync now** in Settings → Sync to register the install in `tabatha.browser_profiles`.
3. When signing in on a second browser profile or machine, the bootstrap pull runs automatically on the first sync. Use **↻ Re-pull registry** to re-run it manually.

### Out of scope (deferred to next plan)

- Realtime awareness pings (cross-profile focus/clock chips).
- Clock-stacking warnings when multiple non-personal profiles are clocked in.
- Personal-profile "see-all-my-activity" aggregated dashboard.
- Manager-scoped views over employees' browser profiles.

---

## [v4.7.6] - Supabase sync Batch 1 durable data coverage - _2026-05-18_

### Added

- Added Supabase migration 008 for durable local data: operations, initiatives, clients, projects, task registry, clock sessions, and desktop activity.
- Extended `syncService` to push `tabathaOrg`, completed focus history, `clockHistory`, `companionRecentSessions`, and `desktopActivity`.
- Added watermarks for clock and desktop activity sync (`lastClockSync`, `lastDesktopActivitySync`) and storage-change sync triggers for direct page writes.

### Changed

- Focus sync now includes `focusEngine.history` as completed rows in `tabatha.focus_items`, not only active/queued items.
- Clock-out now explicitly queues a Supabase sync in addition to the regular storage-change/alarm paths.

### Required Supabase migration

Run `supabase/migrations/008_add_batch1_sync_tables.sql` before relying on Batch 1 sync tables. Until migration 008 is applied, the Sync Status panel will report table-specific upsert failures.

---

## [v4.3.0] - Plan 025: Popup Harmony + Checkpoint Progress Notes + Context-Link - _2026-05-17_

### Added

- **Singleton Popup Coordination** (#185): FTE/WBP overlays no longer stack across tabs. A `_activePopup` storage key tracks the active overlay; all other tabs skip rendering. Actions taken on any surface (home, sidebar, InBar) broadcast `POPUP_DISMISSED` to auto-clear stale overlays everywhere.
- **Enhanced FTE CTAs**: Focus Timer Expired card expanded from 2 buttons to 6: ⏱️ Extend 5m, 🔄 Switch Focus (inline picker), ⏸ Pause, ☕ Step Away (break), ✅ Complete, 📝 Add Note.
- **Combo Popup** (FTE + WBP): When the focus timer expires while the user is away, a single merged `FOCUS_RETURN_COMBO` card shows idle duration (with seconds) + all FTE CTAs + Resume. Replaces the previous two-popup stack.
- **Configurable WBP Thresholds**: `welcomeBackMinIdleMinutes` (default 5) and `welcomeBackShowAfterBreak` (default true) in Settings → Follow-through Support.
- **Off-Device Tag**: Boolean on focus items — when true, suppresses FTE/WBP/nudge popups and Chrome notifications. Toggle in home FocusBar and sidebar.
- **Checkpoint Progress Notes** (#184): Timed auto-prompts at configurable intervals (`checkpointIntervalFraction`, default ⅓ of focus timer). Progress levels: `stuck` (0), `none` (0), `little` (1), `lot` (3), `almost_done` (4). Each CPN stored with `progressValue` for future scoring.
- **CPN Snooze**: "Remind me in 5 min" on checkpoint prompt defers re-prompt.
- **CPN Smart Suppression**: Auto-prompt skipped when a subtask/linked task was recently completed (only checked when subtasks exist).
- **InBar Manual Checkpoint** (📋): Amber-highlighted button when no checkpoint logged in 30+ minutes. Opens inline CPN overlay with progress-level buttons.
- **InBar Staleness Signal**: Pulsing amber dot on the checkpoint button when `lastCheckpointAt` exceeds `checkpointStaleMinutes` (default 30).
- **Sidebar Checkpoint**: 📋 button in sidebar focus panel with inline textarea + progress-level buttons.
- **Home CPN Timeline**: Collapsible checkpoint history in the FocusBar with timestamped entries.
- **Follow-through Support Settings**: New settings section with toggles for checkpoint prompts, interval fraction slider, staleness threshold, WBP min idle, and Asana auto-post.
- **Context-Link Indicator** (#186): InBar center label shows 🔗 (linked) or ⚡ (unlinked) icon based on whether the current tab is in `activeFocus.associatedTabIds`.
- **Window Counts** (#186): Home FocusBar and sidebar focus card now display unique window count alongside tab count (e.g. "3 tabs · 2 windows").
- **CPN → Follow-Through Heatmap**: ActivityHeatmap's "Follow-Through" view now counts both focus completions and checkpoint note submissions per day.

### Changed

- **`GET_INBAR_DATA` response** expanded with `isTabLinked` (boolean) and `windowCount` (computed via `chrome.tabs.get` across associated tabs).
- **`focusService` alarm routing**: `checkpoint-prompt-{focusId}` alarm created on `startFocus()`, cleared on complete/pause/switch.

### Feature Docs

- `docs/features/184-checkpoint-progress-notes.md` — CPN data model, behavior spec, settings
- `docs/features/185-popup-harmony.md` — Singleton coordination, combo popup, WBP thresholds
- `docs/features/186-context-link-indicator.md` — Link indicator, window counts

## [v4.0.0] - Cumulative release: v3.0 → v4.0 + Plan 023 service decomposition - _2026-05-14_

This is the first cumulative release going to `staging` since `v3.0.0`. It carries
**~35 intermediate development versions** (v3.12.4-α → v3.34.5) that lived on the
integration branch but never landed on `staging`, plus the Plan-023 background
service decomposition (v3.34.5 → v4.0.0). The version was bumped to MAJOR as a
marker for the magnitude of the drop, not because of any individual breaking
change in the ledger sense.

> **Action required after install:** apply [`supabase/migrations/005_add_profile_defaults.sql`](supabase/migrations/005_add_profile_defaults.sql) in the Supabase SQL Editor. Without it, your profile select fails silently and Supabase sync never pushes any data. See **Required Supabase migration** below.

---

### 🚀 Added — Major features delivered in this window

- **Intent-to-Focus Bridge** (v3.34.5): typing an intent on a tab can auto-queue/auto-create a matching focus item, configurable via `intentBridgeMode` (`manual` / `smart_dedup` / `always`).
- **Create Focus from Tab** + **Browser Profile Identity** (v3.34.5): each browser profile gets a stable ID stored in `chrome.storage.local.browserProfileId` for cross-device routing.
- **Sidebar edit parity + InBar create focus** (v3.31.5): edit dropdown, refresh button, focus queue mutations from sidebar match home parity.
- **Project / Client tag editing** (v3.30.5): live edit of focus tags (`realm`, `client`, `project`, `task`) on the active focus.
- **Activity Editor + Timeline breaks + Webhook intervals** (v3.29.5): per-entry trim/split/merge, manual break insertion on the timeline, configurable webhook firing cadence.
- **Desktop Activity editor** (v3.25.2): trim/clear tools for desktop activity captured via companion bridge.
- **Sidebar intent creation with timer parity** (v3.24.2): new-focus input now lives in sidebar too.
- **Timeline today-filter** (v3.23.2): desktop activity timeline scoped to current day by default.
- **InBar layout overhaul + URL pause matching** (v3.21.0): paused-intent state survives URL changes when the new URL still matches the pattern.
- **Task storage migration + funnel stage state machine** (v3.20.0): legacy `tasks[]` array → structured `tabathaOrg.tasks` registry. Funnel stages canonicalized: `unsorted → todo → focus → addressing → resolved → roadblocked`. One-time, flag-gated migration runs once per profile.
- **Multi-task picker + auto-fill cascade + business attribution + task CRUD** (Tier-3): hierarchy-aware task selection, parent → child tag inheritance.
- **Org hierarchy + stage editing + resolution tracking** (Tier-3): full org-tree view with stage editor.
- **Initiatives panel** (Tier-3): roll-up of focuses by initiative across the org tree.
- **AnalyticsDashboard** (post-3.12.4): 5 stat cards (focuses today, focus time, completion rate, streak, open tasks), top-focuses bar chart, category-time breakdown, context distribution.
- **ActivityHeatmap** ×3 (v3.12.4-α): GitHub-style 365-day contribution graph with three views — Browser, Overall, Follow-Through.
- **ProjectsClientsPanel + InitiativesPanel** (v3.12.4-α): full client/project view.
- **KeyboardShortcuts + VoiceInput** (v3.12.4-α): expanded keyboard chords and voice intent capture.
- **InBar Edit Dropdown** (v3.12.4-α): ✏️ inline panel for intent edit, focus assignment, new focus creation.
- **InBar Intent/Focus Split** (v3.12.4-α): tab intent and central focus shown separately with divider.
- **Focus Pause/Resume + Focus Edit + Side-Quest Auto-Pause** (v3.12.4-α): paused focuses move to queue with amber styling; resume reactivates timer.
- **Auto-Park paused tabs on close** (v3.12.4-α): paused tabs auto-park with their sticky-note preserved.
- **Tab label editing + Link Tab to Intent** (v3.12.4-α): inline rename, tab-picker dropdown for intent linking.
- **Collapsible homepage sections** (v3.12.4-α): persisted collapse state for every section.
- **Data Retention Alarm** (v3.12.4-α): daily prune of companion/desktop activity older than configurable threshold (default 90d).
- **LogsPanel overhaul** (v3.12.4-α): 8 log types with toggleable filter chips and pagination (50/load).

### 🆕 Added — v4.0.0 quality-of-life

- **Editable display name** in Settings → Account: click your name to edit. Writes through to `tabatha.profiles.display_name`.
- **Manual `Export Markdown` button** in Settings → Export & Agents: downloads a snapshot of active tabs, contexts, closed sessions, and time tracking on demand. The auto-export alarm continues to work as before.
- **Sync Status panel** in Settings → Account: shows last successful sync time and a recent-events log of any sync diagnostics (no profile row, missing columns, upsert errors, etc.). Surfaces failures without needing the Service Worker DevTools console.

### 🔧 Internal — Plan 023 service decomposition

- **Background service decomposition**: `background.js` collapsed from 2,920 lines (staging) → 169 lines (orchestrator only). Runtime message routing, listener registration, and alarm dispatch now live in dedicated services: `tabService`, `focusService`, `taskService`, `clockService`, `clockTickService`, `tabTrackingService`, `categoryService`, `sessionService`, `notificationService`, `settingsService`, `groupService`, `blockgateService`, `companionService`, `alarmService`, `syncService`.
- **Alarm consolidation**: three `chrome.alarms.onAlarm` listeners merged into a single dispatcher in `alarmService`; `supabase-sync` is auth-guarded before dispatch (skipped when no Supabase session, no longer enters `syncToSupabase` and bails inside).
- **Storage caps**: `intentHistory`, `closedContexts`, `sessions`, `sugarBox`, and `focusEngine.history` archived through `archiveBeforeCap` instead of being silently truncated.
- **Settings → Storage** block: `settings.storage.*` with additive migration. New tunables: `sugarBoxCap`, `snapshotIntervalMinutes`, `archivedTasksColdAfterDays`, `parkedTabsWarnAt`, `pendingTimeLogsWarnAt`, `focusHistoryCap`, `closedContextsCap`, `intentHistoryCap`.
- **Companion reconnect** is now exponential-backoff capped at 30s instead of constant fast retry.
- **`COMPANION_IDLE_STATE`**: transitional broadcast — companion-detected idle is now mirrored to all extension pages.
- **`clockTickService`**: shared 1Hz tick broadcaster (`TICK_SUBSCRIBE`, `TICK_UNSUBSCRIBE`, `GET_TICK_STATUS`) so extension pages can stop running per-component intervals.
- **`PARKED_TABS_WARNING` broadcast**: one-shot when parked tabs hit `settings.storage.parkedTabsWarnAt`.
- **`STORAGE_CAP_WARNING` broadcast**: emitted when sugarBox entries fall off the cap.

### 🐛 Fixed — Critical pre-Plan-023 fixes

- **Critical: data loss + break/focus sync + funnel reorder**: prior to v3.13 a race in clock+focus state machines could discard active-focus state on break end.
- **Critical: TDZ + API consistency**: temporal dead-zone errors during boot caused unpredictable startup state.
- **InBar `SET_INTENT` was silently dropped** (v3.22.1): handler was missing entirely from the background router until this fix.
- **Drifted-focus timer extension preserved elapsed time** (v3.22.1): previously reset to zero on extend.
- **Duplicate notification listeners** (v0.2.5-α): merged into single handler; eliminated service-worker unpredictability.
- **`activeTabId` ReferenceError** in welcome-back notification — replaced with `WINDOW_ID_CURRENT`.
- **`triggerSync` excessive firing** (v0.2.5-α): auth-session guard added.
- **`useChromeStorage` stale closure** (v0.2.5-α): `update` callback now uses `useRef` to avoid capturing stale `value`.
- **`patternToRegex` double-escape** (v0.2.5-α): rewrote to split on `*` first, escape segments individually.
- **Status normalization** (v3.17.24): inconsistent display of `complete` vs `completed` across UI surfaces.
- Stage pills, palette nav, task delete, InPop nesting, stage-state sync, paused→resolved transitions, T2.1/T2.3/T4.2 surface fixes (v3.17.13 → v3.17.24): cluster of post-merge user-testing fixes.
- **`logEvent` was used before it was defined** in background.js — defined.
- **Timeline tooltip clipping** (v3.0.0-α): portal'd to `document.body` to escape backdrop-filter containing block; max z-index applied.
- **Corner radius / InBar label fallback / responsive FlipClock / task delete confirm**: UI polish.

### 🐛 Fixed — v4.0.0 cleanup pass (this release)

- **Completed-focus counter never incremented**: AnalyticsDashboard read `intentHistory` for resolved counts, but `completeFocus()` moves items into `engine.history`. Two storage keys, never crossed. The dashboard now sources resolved focuses from `focusHistory` directly. ([src/home/AnalyticsDashboard.jsx](src/home/AnalyticsDashboard.jsx))
- **Streak counted only queue items**: extended to include `engine.history` and the currently-active focus, so a day where you only completed focuses still counts in the streak. ([src/home/AnalyticsDashboard.jsx](src/home/AnalyticsDashboard.jsx))
- **Supabase sync silently bailed forever**: `tabatha.profiles` was missing the `default_org_id` and `default_team_id` columns that both `useAuth.fetchProfile` and `syncService.syncToSupabase` were selecting. The error was thrown away, sync logged "No profile found for user" misleadingly, and nothing ever made it to Supabase. Fixed by:
  - New [`supabase/migrations/005_add_profile_defaults.sql`](supabase/migrations/005_add_profile_defaults.sql) adds both columns (nullable, FK to organizations/teams).
  - `syncService` and `useAuth` now use `maybeSingle()`, capture the error, and fall back to a minimal `SELECT id` so the rest of the flow still works pre-migration.
  - Every silent bail now writes a row to `chrome.storage.local._syncDiagnostics`, surfaced in Settings → Account.
- **Display name stuck at "Tabatha User"**: until now there was no UI to change it. Profile rows auto-provisioned without an OAuth `full_name` (e.g. from magic-link or password sign-up) had no way to be fixed. Added inline editor in Settings → Account.
- **No on-demand markdown export**: the `EXPORT_MARKDOWN` handler existed in `sessionService` but nothing in the UI called it. Auto-export still worked. Added a button in Settings → Export & Agents.
- **Transitional `serviceFlags.focus.ready` stub removed** from `tabService`: PR #11 left a dormant feature flag and dead fallback bodies for `autoQueueFromIntent` / `linkTabToFocus`. Both call sites now delegate directly through the injected `focusService` deps.

### ⚠️ Schema notes

- **`intentChangeLog` removed** — merged into `intentHistory` with a union shape (one-time, flag-gated migration via `_intentLogMigrated`). External readers must read `intentHistory`.
- **Legacy `tasks[]` migrated** to `tabathaOrg.tasks` registry (one-time, flag-gated via `_tasksMigrated`). The legacy `tasks` key is set to `[]` after migration; a snapshot is briefly stored in `_legacyTasksBackup` then removed by tabService's one-shot cleanup.
- **Archived tasks** older than `settings.storage.archivedTasksColdAfterDays` (default 90d) move from `tabathaOrg.tasks` to `_archivedTasks` (internal cold-store key).
- **`settings.storage` block** added with additive migration — user-tuned values preserved, missing fields back-filled from `DEFAULT_SETTINGS.storage`.

### 🛠 Required Supabase migration

Run [`supabase/migrations/005_add_profile_defaults.sql`](supabase/migrations/005_add_profile_defaults.sql) in the Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tabatha.profiles
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS default_org_id UUID REFERENCES tabatha.organizations(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
ALTER TABLE tabatha.profiles
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS default_team_id UUID REFERENCES tabatha.teams(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS profiles_default_org_idx ON tabatha.profiles(default_org_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS profiles_default_team_idx ON tabatha.profiles(default_team_id);
```

The extension boots and operates without this migration (sync falls back to a minimal profile select that omits org/team scoping), but no rows reach `focus_items` / `intent_history` until the columns exist.

### 📦 Upgrade procedure (existing v3.34.5 unpacked install)

Data is preserved by chrome.storage migrations — `intentChangeLog`, legacy tasks, and additive settings backfill all run flag-gated and idempotently. The key thing is to upgrade **in-place** so Chrome keeps the same extension ID:

1. Back up your data first (open any Tabatha page DevTools console → `chrome.storage.local.get(null, d => copy(JSON.stringify(d)))` → paste to a `.json` file).
2. Apply the Supabase migration above.
3. Overwrite the contents of your existing `dist/` directory with the new v4.0.0 build (do NOT load v4.0.0 from a new path — that creates a second extension ID with empty storage).
4. In `chrome://extensions`, hit "Reload" on the same Tabatha extension card.
5. Open the Service Worker (or any Tabatha page) once so bootstrap migrations fire.
6. Settings → Account → confirm `Sync Status` shows a recent successful sync.

### 🔁 Known limitations (not blockers, planned follow-up)

- Supabase sync is currently one-directional (local → cloud). Tabs/focuses created on Browser A don't auto-pull to Browser B.
- `tabathaOrg` (clients/projects/tasks/operations/initiatives) is local-only; not synced to Supabase yet.
- Tab groups created via Chrome's built-in UI are tracked by Tabatha's `groupService` but not surfaced in any Tabatha panel — no per-group view yet.
- Companion bridge has no profile scoping; running Tabatha in two browser profiles simultaneously will cause both to share companion events. Stop the companion app before regression-testing in a second profile.

## [v3.34.5] - Intent-to-Focus Bridge + Browser Profile Identity - _2026-05-12_

### Added
- **Intent-to-Focus Bridge**: typing an intent on a tab can auto-queue/auto-create a matching focus item, configurable via `intentBridgeMode` (`manual` / `smart_dedup` / `always`).
- **Create Focus from Tab**: new-focus flow accessible directly from tab cards, pre-filled with the tab's URL and title.
- **Browser Profile Identity**: each Chrome profile gets a stable `browserProfileId` stored in `chrome.storage.local` for future cross-device routing.

## [v3.12.4-alpha] - InBar, Focus Controls, Heatmap, Logs & Activity Overhaul - _2026-05-11_

### Added
- **InBar Edit Dropdown**: ✏️ button opens inline panel for intent editing, focus assignment, and new focus creation — all from the content bar.
- **InBar Intent/Focus Split**: Bar now shows tab intent and central focus separately with a visual divider.
- **Focus Pause/Resume**: ⏸ button on FocusBar freezes timer, moves focus to queue with amber styling. FocusInput reappears for new focus.
- **Focus Edit**: ✏️ button on FocusBar for inline rename, timer adjust, and funnel stage changes.
- **Side-Quest Auto-Pause**: Starting a side quest automatically pauses the current active focus and resumes it when the side quest ends.
- **Auto-Park on Close**: Paused tabs auto-park with their sticky note preserved when closed.
- **Tab Label Editing**: ✏️ rename button on each tab card in the Tabs panel. Custom titles persist with original shown on hover.
- **Link Tab to Intent**: 📄 Link Tab button in IntentsPanel with inline open-tab picker dropdown.
- **Collapsible Sections**: All homepage sections collapsible with persisted state (Shift Controls, Now Bar, Focus Engine, Activity, Nav Tabs).
- **Activity Heatmaps (×3)**: GitHub-style contribution graph with 3 views — Browser, Overall, Follow-Through. Theme-aware colors, hover tooltips, 365-day range.
- **Context Activity Bar**: Renamed from "Desktop Activity" to include browser + desktop + mobile (future) segments.
- **Data Retention Alarm**: Daily chrome.alarm prunes companion/desktop activity older than configurable threshold (default 90 days).
- **Data Retention Setting**: Configurable in Settings → Time Tracking with description text.
- **Parked Tab Notes**: Parked tabs display context badge, auto-park source indicator, and preserved sticky notes.

### Changed
- **LogsPanel Overhaul**: Now supports 8 log types (Tab Activity, Intent Change, Focus Session, Clock Stint, Break, Context Set, Blocked Site, Task Update) with toggleable filter chips and pagination (50 per load). Desktop activity excluded — reserved for Context Activity Bar.
- **Header Spacing**: Reduced padding above/below header. Clock wrapper fixed-height prevents layout shift at different scales.
- **Version**: Bumped to 3.12.4-alpha across manifest.json, settings, and homepage.

## [v0.2.5-alpha] - Diagnostic Fix Sweep - _2026-05-09_

### Fixed
- **Critical: Duplicate notification listeners** merged into single handler; eliminated service worker unpredictability.
- **Critical: `activeTabId` ReferenceError** in welcome-back notification handler — replaced with `WINDOW_ID_CURRENT`.
- **Critical: `export` keyword on `triggerSync()`** removed — prevented potential service worker module loading failure.
- **Clock-In/Out race condition** — eliminated double-writes to `clockSession` storage key; UI now relies on reactive `useChromeStorage` listener.
- **Focus actions fragility** — `completeFocus()` and `extendTimer()` now receive explicit `focusId` in home and sidebar.
- **Time tracking shows 0s** — added `updateTimeTrackingAggregates()` to bridge `pendingTimeLogs` and the `timeTracking.byTab` storage key the UI reads.
- **Gatekeeper Sugar Box/Park/Later** — buttons now close overlay and tab as tooltips promised.
- **`useChromeStorage` stale closure** — `update` callback uses `useRef` to avoid capturing stale `value`.
- **Popup `new URL()` crash** — wrapped in try/catch for `chrome://` and malformed URLs.
- **`triggerSync` excessive firing** — added auth session guard to skip Supabase calls when unauthenticated.
- **`patternToRegex` double-escape** — rewrote to split on `*` first, escape segments individually.

### Changed
- **Shared `formatTime` utility** — extracted from 3 duplicate definitions into `src/utils/formatTime.js`.

## [v0.2.4-alpha] - Phase 3/4 Refinements - _2026-04-28_

### Added
- **Logs Panel**: Replaced simple Time view with deep filtering (Date, Intent, Category, Duration) for historical activity tracking.
- **Link/Merge Modal**: Universal modal to link Tabs to Intents, or merge Intents into Tasks.
- **Settings Walkthrough**: In-app educational tooltips describing "When", "How", and "Affects" for all configuration options.
- **Theme Expansion**: High contrast corporate theme, plus 5 new distinct themes (Neo-Brutalism, Glass Ocean, Retro Pixel, Solarized Warm, High Contrast Dark).
- **Background Handlers**: Automated logic for `CLOCK_IN`, `CLOCK_OUT`, and `TOGGLE_BREAK`.

### Changed
- **Gatekeeper Parked Tabs**: Automatically restores session context for parked tabs, preventing redundant Gatekeeper prompts.
- **Dashboard Refinement**: Renamed "Contexts" to "Sessions" and added "Link/Close" actions to tab listings.

---

## [v0.1.5] - Phase 1.5 (User Enhancements) - _2026-02-12_

### Added

- **Gatekeeper Overlay**: A new interception mechanism for empty tabs. Instead
  of a redirect or modal, a dark, immersive overlay appears on new tabs asking
  for context/intent.
  - Options: "Continue" (set context), "Side Quest" (5m timer), "Sugar Box"
    (save for later), "Park" (save for later).
- **Quick Access**: "Speed Dial" on the Welcome Page. Clicking a top site
  immediately launches it with the context typed in the "New Session Intent"
  box, bypassing the Gatekeeper.
- **Welcome Page Parity**: The "New Tab" page (`home.html`) is now a
  full-featured dashboard mirroring the Sidebar.
  - Features: Tab list, Context view, Groups management, Time tracking, Restore
    Session.
  - Design: "Mission Control" desktop layout with wider UI elements.
- **Time Tracking Logic**:
  - Added "Active Time" tracking per tab (persists across sessions).
  - Added "Open Duration" display.
  - Added Pomodoro timer constraints.
- **Sugar Box & Parked Tabs**: Stub storage implementations for saving
  distractions (Sugar Box) and keeping tabs for later (Parked).

### Changed

- **Welcome Page UI**: Completely overhauled `home.html` and `home.css` to use a
  glassmorphism "Mission Control" aesthetic, sharing styles with the Sidebar.
- **Tab Restore**: Improved "Return to Flow" logic to better handle session
  restoration with priorities.
- **Manifest**: Added `topSites` permission for Quick Access feature.

### Fixed

- **Empty Sidebar Bug**: Fixed an issue where the sidebar would be empty on
  extension reload because existing tabs weren't re-synced to storage.
- **Layout Issues**: fixed CSS conflicts between `sidebar.css` and `home.css`.

---

## [v0.1.0] - Phase 1 (Core Foundation) - _2026-02-10_

### Added

- **Extension Scaffold**: MV3 Manifest, Service Worker (`background.js`), Side
  Panel, Content Scripts.
- **Context Engine**:
  - Data structure for Tabs, Contexts, Intents, and Priorities.
  - Logic for inheriting context from parent tabs.
- **Sidebar UI**: Rich, interactive sidebar replacing the native vertical tabs.
  - Sections: Intent Dashboard, Tab List, Batch Updates, Groups, Time Tracking.
- **Tab Analysis**:
  - **Categories**: Auto-detection of "Work", "Media", "Social", etc. based on
    URL.
  - **Priority System**: Critical (Red), High (Orange), Medium (Yellow), Low
    (Green).
- **Tab Groups**:
  - Integration with native Chrome Tab Groups.
  - **Sub-Groups**: "Project" layer above Chrome groups.
- **Tab Locking**:
  - **Lock**: Prevent accidental close.
  - **URL Lock**: Prevent navigation away from a specific domain (e.g., lock a
    tab to Asana).
- **Markdown Export**: Auto-generates `Tabatha/context.md` for AI agents to
  understand user context.
- **Idle Detection**: Detects when user leaves Chrome and asks for off-screen
  context upon return.

### Core Philosophy Implementation

- Established the "Context-First" data model where every tab must have a purpose
  or inherit one.
