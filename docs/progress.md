## Session 006/007 — 2026-04-24 (React Migration & Full Build)

**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude Opus 4.6 Thinking)
**Duration:** ~45 min
**Goal:** Migrate to React + Vite + TailwindCSS v4, establish Pop Art/Glassmorphism design system, build core components and dashboard

### What Was Done

- [x] **Repository Reorganization**: Moved entire vanilla JS codebase to `v0_legacy/` folder
- [x] **Vite + React Setup**: Initialized fresh Vite + React project in root
- [x] **Dependencies Installed**: React 19, TailwindCSS v4, Framer Motion
- [x] **Design System**: Created `docs/design.md` — formal protocol with Pop Art + Corporate themes
- [x] **Theme Architecture**: Built CSS variable system with `[data-theme]` switching
- [x] **Multi-page Config**: `vite.config.js` configured for Home, Sidebar, Popup, Background, and Gatekeeper entry points
- [x] **Manifest v3**: Updated `public/manifest.json` to v1.0.0 targeting Vite output paths
- [x] **Core Hooks**: Created `useChromeStorage` (reactive state sync), `sendMessage` (background comms), `useTheme` (theme switching)
- [x] **UI Components**: Built `GlassCard` and `PopButton` with theme-adaptive styling
- [x] **FlipClock Port**: Full port of Refocus 3D split-flap clock from TypeScript to React JSX (all countdown modes, settings, pulse animations)
- [x] **Home Dashboard**: Complete rebuild with FlipClock at top, intent/focus bar with shake animation, 3 nav panels (Time, Tabs, Contexts), category breakdown, active sessions list
- [x] **Sidebar**: Full tab list with priority dots, search, context groups, Framer Motion transitions
- [x] **Popup**: Quick-switch panel with fuzzy search, MRU sorting, staggered entry animations
- [x] **Build Verified**: `npm run build` succeeds cleanly — all assets compile to `dist/`
- [x] **Dev Server**: `npm run dev` runs on localhost:5173
- [x] **Roadmap Updated**: Added Phase 5 (Flux Ecosystem) to ROADMAP.md

## Session 011 � 2026-04-27 (Logs Panel & Theme Refactor)

**Agent:** Antigravity
**Goal:** Finalize Link/Merge modal, Tabs actions, Logs Panel deep filtering, and Theme expansion.

### What Was Done
- [x] **Link/Merge Modal**: Implemented UI for linking tabs to intents and merging intents.
- [x] **Dashboard Tab Actions**: Added Link and Close buttons to active tabs.
- [x] **Theme System Expansion**: Updated Corporate theme for high contrast and added 5 new drastically different themes (Neo-Brutalism, Glass Ocean, Retro Pixel, Solarized Warm, High Contrast Dark).
- [x] **Settings Walkthrough**: Finished wrapping all settings in the tooltips.

### Next Steps
- Address the general backlog (Sync logic, Supabase backend integration).

## Session 012 - 2026-04-29 (Auth UI, Clock Fix, Full Audit)

**Agent:** Antigravity
**Goal:** Complete auth UI, fix clock handlers, audit homepage/sidebar/settings parity, investigate InBar.

### What Was Done
- [x] **useAuth hook**: Created src/hooks/useAuth.js with reactive Supabase session, auto-profile provisioning, org/team membership tracking.
- [x] **Settings Sync section**: Full refactor to useAuth � profile card, linked identities, org/team display, invite token redemption with inline banners.
- [x] **Duplicate clock handlers removed**: Deleted inferior CLOCK_IN/CLOCK_OUT/TOGGLE_BREAK (~L1606); kept robust versions (~L1822) with break archiving.
- [x] **Homepage theme sync**: Theme cycle now includes all 12 themes (was only 7).
- [x] **Dead polling removed**: Removed unused GET_TIME_TRACKING intervals from homepage and sidebar.
- [x] **Work Clock settings**: Added new settings section with auto-clock-in, break reminder, and clock history toggles.
- [x] **InBar investigation**: Traced full injection chain (manifest ? content script ? background handler). InBar works but only appears when focus/context is active.
- [x] **InBar discoverability**: Added helper text in Settings explaining activation requirements.
- [x] **Cross-representation audit**: Verified all Settings toggles have backend support and all features have Settings representation.

### Key Findings
- InBar is fully wired (manifest, build, content script, background) but silently invisible without active focus/context.
- Sidebar is feature-complete for its compact form factor.
- Export and Privacy backend handlers need deeper audit.

### Next Steps
- Consider making InBar show a minimal "No intent" prompt for discoverability.
- Audit Export backend handlers.
- Verify Privacy capture toggles have backend support.
- Add GET_AUTH_STATUS message handler for cross-page auth queries.

### Session 012 Addendum (continued work)

- [x] **InBar visual preview**: Added interactive preview in Settings showing both the full bar and collapsed nub states
- [x] **InBar "No intent" fallback**: InBar now always shows when enabled, displaying "No intent set � click to set" prompt when no focus/context is active
- [x] **InBar nub toggle**: Close button now collapses to a tiny 20px circle nub instead of fully removing; click to re-expand
- [x] **InBar notes panel**: Added ?? button that expands a quick-note panel for jotting thoughts about the current focus/task/intent � auto-saves with debounce
- [x] **Background handlers**: Added SAVE_INBAR_NOTE and GET_INBAR_NOTES message handlers for persistent note storage
- [x] **Tabs layout fix**: Active tabs now in 2-column grid at top; recently closed moved to compact list below with trimmed domains
- [x] **Clock container fix**: Changed from flex: 1 1 auto to 0 0 auto with minimal padding � container now shrinks with clock scale
- [x] **Focus input feedback**: Added pending/loading state to Set Focus button so users see feedback when clicking

## Session 015 � 2026-04-29

### Goal
Build the Asana Time Tracker Widget (Flux plugin) � end-to-end from spec to working server.

### Work Done
- [x] **Design spec created**: Full v1 spec covering Asana widget API constraints, 3 widget states (tracking/idle/empty), modal form designs, and data architecture
- [x] **Express server built** (`flux-asana-widget/`): Routes for widget metadata, form metadata, form submit, and OAuth auth
- [x] **Supabase schema** (migration 004): `flux_time_entries` table with computed duration, uniqueness constraints, and performance indexes
- [x] **Migration applied** via Supabase CLI (`npx supabase db push`)
- [x] **SSL certs generated** for HTTPS (required by Asana)
- [x] **Lazy Supabase init**: Server boots cleanly even without `.env` configured (mock mode)
- [x] **Security middleware**: Request expiry validation and optional HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
- [x] **CORS**: Locked to `app.asana.com` origin
- [x] **End-to-end tested**: Start timer (Alice), start timer (Bob), stop timer (Alice), verify multi-user widget state � all passing against live Supabase

### Key Findings
- Asana widgets are JSON-only � one template (`summary_with_details_v0`), no custom HTML/CSS/JS
- Interactions happen via Modal Forms (entry point click), not widget buttons
- `datetime_with_icon` fields auto-format relative time in Asana UI
- Computed `duration_s` column avoids needing to calculate in application code

### Next Steps
- Register the app in Asana Developer Console (https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps)
- Configure Widget Metadata URL, Form URLs, and Entry Point label
- Add proper user name resolution via Asana API (currently uses GID suffix)
- Consider v1.1: manual time entry form for retroactive logging
- v1.2: Tabatha browser integration � auto-track from browser focus state

### 2026-04-29 � InPop/InBar/Asana Fixes
**Goal:** Fix InPop common list clicks, InBar visibility, and Asana URL auto-intent

**What was done:**
- [x] Fixed SET_TAB_CONTEXT � now auto-creates tab entry if missing (InPop preset clicks were silently failing)
- [x] Fixed SAVE_INBAR_NOTE � corrected equest vs message variable name bug
- [x] Rebuilt extension � InBar build was stale (old version without nub/notes/discovery state)
- [x] Added Asana URL auto-intent in CHECK_CONTEXT_NEEDED � detects app.asana.com task URLs and extracts task name from page title
- [x] Added Asana auto-intent in onTabUpdated � catches the race condition where gatekeeper fires before title loads
- [x] Verified all InPop message handlers exist in background.js switch statement

**Key findings:**
- InBar was invisible because dist/assets/inbar.js was stale (old build without nub/notes)
- InPop common preset clicks DID call closeOverlay() but SET_TAB_CONTEXT silently failed if tab data wasn't created yet
- SAVE_INBAR_NOTE used equest instead of message � would always crash

**Next steps:**
- Reload extension in chrome://extensions and test all 3 features
- Consider adding Asana API integration (via personal access token) for richer task details beyond just the title

## Session 016 - 2026-05-09

### Goal
Fix all issues identified in the full diagnostic report (16 issues across critical/high/medium/low severity).

### Work Done
- [x] **Critical #1**: Merged duplicate 
otifications.onClicked listeners into single unified handler
- [x] **Critical #2**: Fixed undefined ctiveTabId ReferenceError - replaced with WINDOW_ID_CURRENT
- [x] **Critical #3**: Removed export from 	riggerSync() preventing service worker module loading failure
- [x] **High #4**: Fixed clock-in/out race condition - removed double-writes to clockSession storage
- [x] **High #6**: Passed explicit ctiveFocus.id to completeFocus/extendTimer in home + sidebar
- [x] **Medium #8**: Bridged 	imeTracking.byTab gap - added updateTimeTrackingAggregates() to populate UI data
- [x] **Medium #9**: Fixed Gatekeeper Sugar Box/Park/Later buttons to close overlay + tab
- [x] **Medium #10**: Fixed useChromeStorage stale closure bug using useRef
- [x] **Low #12**: Wrapped 
ew URL() in popup with try/catch
- [x] **Low #14**: Added auth session guard to 	riggerSync to avoid unnecessary Supabase calls
- [x] **Low #15**: Extracted shared ormatTime utility to src/utils/formatTime.js
- [x] **Low #16**: Fixed patternToRegex double-escape edge case

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| src/background/background.js | #1, #2, #3, #14, #16 |
| src/home/index.jsx | #4, #6, #15 |
| src/sidebar/index.jsx | #6, #15 |
| src/popup/index.jsx | #12, #15 |
| src/hooks/useChromeStorage.js | #10 |
| src/content/gatekeeper.js | #9 |
| src/services/timeTracking.js | #8 |
| src/utils/formatTime.js | #15 (new) |

### Key Decisions
- Skipped #11 (FlipClock magic numbers) - cosmetic, needs design review
- Skipped #13 (Supabase anon key) - anon keys are public by design
- #5 (FocusInput stuck) already had adequate error handling
- #7 (sidebar clock buttons) resolved by fixing #10 (the hook itself)

### Next Steps
- Reload extension in chrome://extensions and verify Service Worker console is error-free
- Test clock-in/out flow, focus set/complete, and gatekeeper buttons end-to-end
- Monitor time tracking data populating in the UI
